</details>

## Getting Started

1. **Install** with the command above.
2. **`/alethe setup`** checks which agent CLIs you have and whether they are logged in, lists their models, and proposes three profiles: base, savings and aggressive. Nothing is saved until you approve.
3. **`/alethe always`** (optional) keeps it on in every project, so you never type `/alethe` again.
4. **Ask for the work**: `/alethe move the billing endpoints to v2`, or just ask in plain words while it is on. The lead picks a playbook, previews the plan and runs the workers.
5. **`/alethe status`** while it runs, **`/alethe stop`** to stop it.
6. **`/alethe report`** when it is done: what each worker did, why, and what it cost. **`/alethe mark <worker> used`** records what you kept.

    <img src="./docs/assets/drawings/how-it-works-light.svg" alt="You ask your agent to orchestrate a refactor. The lead agent picks a playbook, writes the briefs and dry-runs the plan, then orchestrate.py runs one wave of workers: Claude Code on haiku, read-only; Codex at low effort, writing in its own worktree; Antigravity, read-only. They leave result.md, diff.patch and outcome.json while full transcripts stay on disk. The lead reads only the results, checks, integrates and marks them, runs the next wave, and finally writes the orchestration report" width="900">

## Commands

Type them after `/alethe`.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `setup` | Checks your CLIs and sets everything up |
| `<task>` | Orchestrates the task |
| `always` | Keeps it on in every project |
| `status` | Where it stands |
| `stop` | Stops the workers |
| `report` | What each worker did and cost |
| `off` | Turns it off here |

`/alethe help` lists the rest.

## Keep It On

With `always` or `on`, every prompt reminds the lead of your goal and rules, and it decides per request whether to hand work off.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./docs/assets/drawings/stay-on-dark.svg">
    <img src="./docs/assets/drawings/stay-on-light.svg" alt="A conversation. The first message says /alethe from now on, be careful with the database, and the lead turns the mode on with careful and keeps the words as a rule. The next messages need no /alethe: a hook reminds the lead of the goal, care and rules each time. It fixes a typo itself because it is too small to hand off, orchestrates moving 40 endpoints with cheap scouts and writers in worktrees, and answers how is it going with a short status. It stays on for the project until /alethe off or 12 hours without a prompt" width="820">

## Join Mid-Task

It joins halfway through another skill's workflow: the spec and the diff so far become the plan.

    <img src="./docs/assets/drawings/mid-task-light.svg" alt="A tasks.md from a spec-driven workflow with tasks 1 to 3 done. /alethe joins at task 4. The lead takes the spec and the diff so far as the plan and sends tasks 4 and 5 out: four Codex writers with one worktree per group, two Claude haiku workers fixing the tests, and the coupled part stays with the lead. Task 6, the review gate, stays with the original workflow, whose checks become the gates" width="860">
  </picture>
</p>

## Change Course

A playbook is a starting point. `skip`, `add`, `switch` and `freeform` change it between waves, and the report lists every change with its reason.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./docs/assets/drawings/change-course-dark.svg">
    <img src="./docs/assets/drawings/change-course-light.svg" alt="Top row, dashed: the scout-then-build playbook, scout, plan, build, review. Bottom row, what ran: scout, plan, a freeform wave to fix the build script because the bug was there, build, and review crossed out because the diff was three lines. The journal.jsonl records each change with its reason, and the report shows them under Changes to the plan" width="820">
  </picture>
</p>

## Playbooks

| Playbook | Use it when | What it saves |
|---|---|---|
| `direct` | The task is narrow and clear, up to about 3 files | All orchestration overhead |
| `cascade` | A mechanical change with an automatic check | Most of the cost, while retries stay rare |
| `scout-then-build` | Unfamiliar code with much to read and little to write | Your context: scouts return summaries, not files |
| `plan-big-execute-small` | Up to about 10 independent reads, audits or checks | The strong tier only decomposes and synthesizes |
| `audit-at-scale` | Dozens or hundreds of similar items | The volume runs on the cheap tier |
| `parallel-worktrees` | Independent modules with disjoint files | Wall time, not tokens |
| `plan-execute` | One feature built in sequential steps | The strong tier is billed only for planning |
| `advisor-escalation` | A long mechanical task with a few hard calls | A strong advisor only at decision points |
| `best-of-n` | A hard, high-stakes fix worth several attempts | Nothing: it buys reliability |
| `review-gate` | A finished diff before merge | Strong review only on diffs worth reviewing |
| `complete` | Anything else; the conditions decide per unit | Each unit runs on the cheapest role that fits |

Any other CLI with a non-interactive mode, such as Kiro, Copilot CLI or Gemini CLI, runs as a custom worker.

## Why It's Different

- **Real spend, never estimated:** tokens and cost as each CLI reported them, split between used and discarded results.
- **Enforced limits:** budgets per wave and per orchestration, a hard cost cap on Claude workers, no subagents.
- **Never runs your quota dry:** it reads Claude and Codex usage before every wave, refuses to start workers past a stop line, and asks you, with options, before it would spend past it.
- **Lean, checked workers:** no MCP servers in Codex and Claude workers, and git catches a read-only worker that wrote.
- **Easy to audit:** Python's standard library only, no shell, no network, no install scripts.

<summary>Runner commands and files</summary>

Your agent runs these for you, from `skills/alethe/scripts/orchestrate.py`:

| Stage | Command | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | `doctor`, `playbook`, `editor`, `policy`, `mode` | Checks the CLIs, prints, shows or edits the playbooks and preferences, keeps it on |
| Plan | `scaffold`, `validate`, `dry-run` | Starts, checks and previews a plan |
| Run | `new`, `run --in current`, `budget`, `note`, `stop` | Runs the waves of one orchestration |
| After | `status`, `mark`, `report`, `list`, `use` | Explains and values what ran |

The policy and your playbooks live in `%APPDATA%\Alethe\` on Windows and `~/.config/alethe/`
elsewhere, with one folder per orchestration under `orchestrations/`:

```text
<folder>/
├── budget.json              limits for every wave, optional
├── 01-explore/
│   ├── state.json           the batch at a glance, live while it runs
│   ├── plan.json            the resolved plan, without task text
│   └── workers/<id>/
│       ├── prompt.txt       the brief the worker received
│       ├── result.md        its final answer
│       ├── outcome.json     status, failure kind, metrics, tripwire
│       ├── diff.patch       what a writer changed
│       ├── mark.json        used, partial or discarded, optional

## Example Playbook

`scout-then-build`: cheap read-only scouts map the code, then one worker writes the change.
`/alethe editor` opens your own playbooks this way, as one offline page where you can switch
profiles, simulate quota and edit a step, then copy the YAML back. It works without Python too.

<p align="center">
