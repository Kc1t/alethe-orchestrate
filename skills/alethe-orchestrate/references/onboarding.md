# Orchestration onboarding

Use this when the user asks to set up the skill or `doctor` finds no saved policy. The result is a
playbooks copy that lists what the user really has, three profiles built from it, and the user's
approval. Ask only what you cannot find out; skip answers already given in the request or saved
policy.

## 1. Take inventory

1. Run `doctor` for the built-in CLIs: Codex, Claude Code, Agy / Antigravity and Kimi Code. A CLI
   with `loggedIn: false` goes in the notes with "log in first", not in `providers`; a run on it
   would fail with `auth_required`.
2. Look on PATH for other agent CLIs, such as `gemini`, `kiro-cli`, `copilot` or `opencode`, and for
   routes such as `9router`. Run each one's `--help` before counting it; a CLI that fails to start
   goes in the notes with the fix, not in `providers`. Ask: "Is there another AI CLI or routing
   tool you want to use?" Accept a name or executable path.
3. List each CLI's models when it has a command for that, such as `agy models` or
   `kiro-cli chat --list-models --format json`. Keep cost multipliers the CLI reports. Codex keeps
   its list in `models_cache.json` under its home folder (`~/.codex` by default); read that file
   instead of starting a session.
4. Record a custom adapter only after `--help` shows a non-interactive prompt mode, and write down
   the command you checked. Never guess flags or credentials. A custom adapter cannot enforce
   read-only work, so it only takes writing phases; see [providers.md](providers.md).
5. Alethe reads Claude, Codex, Antigravity and Kimi usage. Ask about plan end dates, and about the
   usage of the other CLIs, only when a profile depends on them.
6. For a route such as 9router, record whether it is installed and running and which CLIs the user
   wants it to carry. A route is a separate diagram node, not a worker. Inspect the app
   configuration or environment before calling it active, and never start, install or reconfigure
   it.

## 2. Build three profiles

Write three profiles over the same playbooks, using only models the inventory found:

| Profile | Tiers | Order | Switches at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base | Each CLI's usual model per tier | The user's main CLIs first | 80% |
| Savings | One step cheaper per tier; low-multiplier and separate quotas for volume | Cheapest capable CLI first, the scarcest subscription last | 70% |
| Aggressive | One step stronger per tier; `xhigh` still only on escalation | The strongest CLIs first | 95% |

Keep a model empty when the CLI's default is the right choice. Put a read-only phase only where the
CLI enforces read-only work.

## 3. Ask for approval

Show the inventory in a few lines: found, skipped with the reason, and routes. Then show one table
with the three profiles and the model each tier gets on each CLI. Recommend one and ask: "Approve
these profiles, and which one should be active?" Apply changes and show the table again. Never
save or start workers before the user approves.

## 4. Save

1. Run `playbook --init`, adding `--force` only after the user agreed to replace an existing copy,
   and edit the copy it prints: `setup` (date and notes), `providers`, `models`, `adapters`,
   `routes`, `tiers`, `profiles` and `profile`, as [playbooks.md](playbooks.md) describes.
2. Run `policy set --provider-order` with the active profile's built-in CLIs, or `policy set` with
   no options when the defaults fit, so `doctor` records onboarding as complete. A choice limited
   to one run stays out of the policy.
3. Offer a preview diagram of the active profile.

Later, "use savings" or "go aggressive" changes `profile` in the copy; confirm it when it is an
ongoing change, or apply it to this run only.

## Ready-made routes

These are starting points for a wave's runner strategy, not claims that a model is available or
cheapest. Always `probe` before selecting a worker; the local CLI and the user's request take
precedence.

| Goal | Suggested plan | Typical provider choice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Save usage | One bounded reader or writer, `economy`, cheap tier when configured | First available preferred CLI |
| Everyday work | Two independent units, `balanced` | Codex and Claude Code, or two isolated units on one CLI |
| Independent review | Writer, then reviewer, then repair only if needed, `quality` | Review with a different available CLI when possible |
| Compare findings | Two or more read-only investigations, `research` | Mix available CLIs for independent views |
| Implement independent pieces | Disjoint writers in isolated worktrees, `parallel` | Available writing CLIs with explicit file ownership |
| Recover a session | One resumed worker, `rescue` | The same CLI that owns the session ID |

9router routes an agent's API traffic and can be drawn between that agent and its upstream model.
It does not replace the CLI adapter or reveal which upstream model a request used unless that
information is available from the configuration or observed run data.
